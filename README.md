# Django CRM
This project is the V1 of a CRM Application made w/ Django using MySQL Database and Bootstrap, based on CODEMY crash course.
I've made this to improve my knowledge in Django in order to fullfill my daily job needs.

There are some things that u may need to solve before using the platform
